        <h2>A VERY Brief History of HTTP</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</strong> was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 as part of the World Wide Web project.
            The first version, HTTP/0.9, was incredibly simple, as it could literally only fetch an HTML page.
            Over time, new versions were introduced to handle more complexity:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTTP/1.0 (1996):</strong> Added support for status codes, headers, and more MIME types.</li>
            <li><strong>HTTP/1.1 (1997):</strong> Introduced persistent connections, chunked transfer encoding, and caching mechanisms.</li>
            <li><strong>HTTP/2 (2015):</strong> Improved performance with multiplexing, header compression, and binary framing.</li>
            <li><strong>HTTP/3 (2022+):</strong> Uses QUIC instead of TCP for faster, encrypted communication.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How This HTTP Server Works</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Socket Creation:</strong> Before a server can talk to a browser (like Chrome or Firefox), it needs to
                <strong>open a communication channel</strong>. You can think of it like opening a door for visitors. This is done by creating something called a
                <strong>socket</strong>.<br><br>

                A <em>socket</em> is a programming tool that lets two computers talk to each other over a network. Think of it like a phone: it lets your server “pick up calls” from clients (like web browsers).<br><br>

                The server uses the <code>socket()</code> function to create this communication tool. It sets up a
                <strong>TCP socket</strong>, which uses a reliable system that guarantees messages will arrive in the right order without anything missing.
                <br><br>
                Example in C:
                <pre><code>int server_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);</code></pre>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>AF_INET</code> → Use IPv4 addresses.</li>
                    <li><code>SOCK_STREAM</code> → Use TCP for reliable communication.</li>
                    <li><code>0</code> → Use the default protocol for the socket type.</li>
                </ul>

                After creating the socket, the server needs to bind it to a specific port (like 8080) and IP address (like <code>0.0.0.0</code>) so it knows where to listen for messages.

                <pre><code>struct sockaddr_in server_address;
server_address.sin_family = AF_INET;
server_address.sin_port = htons(8080);
server_address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;

bind(server_socket, (struct sockaddr*)&server_address, sizeof(server_address));</code></pre>
                Don't worry if the code isn't perfectly clear right now. As long as you're following at a high level, you're getting all you need to know!
                After this step, the server is telling the operating system:
                <em>“Ready. If anyone sends a message to port 8080, I can hear it.”</em>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Listening:</strong> Now that the server has created and bound a socket to a port, it needs to tell the operating system:
                <em>“I’m not actively talking yet, but I’m ready to listen if anyone wants to connect.”</em><br><br>

                This is done with the <code>listen()</code> function. It puts the socket into <strong>passive mode</strong>, meaning the server won’t initiate any conversations, but it will just sit quietly and wait for someone (a client like a browser) to start talking to it.

                <br><br>
                Here's how it looks in C:
                <pre><code>listen(server_socket, SOMAXCONN);</code></pre>

                <ul>
                    <li><code>server_socket</code> is the socket we created and bound earlier.</li>
                    <li><code>SOMAXCONN</code> is a constant that tells the system how many incoming connections can wait in line (in the "backlog") before they’re accepted. You can also pass a number like <code>5</code> manually (which is what this server does!).</li>
                </ul>

                Once <code>listen()</code> is called, the operating system adds your server to its internal list of <strong>services waiting for connections</strong>. Think of it like flipping on the “Open” sign at a store. No one is there right now, but the shop is ready for them.

                <br><br>
                This step is really important, because without calling <code>listen()</code>, the server won’t receive any connection attempts. It just has a socket bound to a port, but no one is allowed to use it yet. After this call, the server is ready to <strong>accept clients</strong>, which is the next step.
            </li>


            <li>
                <strong>Accepting Clients:</strong> Once the server is in <em>listening mode</em>, it's ready to receive incoming connections.
                <br><br>

                This is done using the <code>accept()</code> function. When a client (like a browser) tries to connect, <code>accept()</code> pulls that client out of the queue and creates a new connection just for them.
                <br><br>

                Here's how that might look in C:
                <pre><code>int client_socket = accept(server_socket, NULL, NULL);</code></pre>

                <ul>
                    <li><code>server_socket</code> is the listening socket that waits for connections.</li>
                    <li>The two <code>NULL</code> values can be used to get info about the client, but we’re skipping that for now.</li>
                    <li><code>client_socket</code> is a brand-new socket created just for this one client, like a private phone line just for them.</li>
                </ul>

                Once the server accepts a client, it can use that new <code>client_socket</code> to communicate directly with that one browser or app.
                <br><br>

                The next step is to actually <strong>receive data</strong> from the client. A typical HTTP request looks like:
                <pre><code>GET / HTTP/1.1</code></pre>

                To do this, the server calls the <code>recv()</code> function:
                <pre><code>char buffer[1024];
int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer) - 1, 0);</code></pre>

                This reads the incoming data from the client and stores it in a buffer so the server can process it.
                <br><br>

                At this point, the server has officially:
                <ul>
                    <li>Welcomed a client (browser) in with <code>accept()</code></li>
                    <li>Read their request using <code>recv()</code></li>
                </ul>

                Now it's ready to figure out what the client wants.
            </li>


            <li>
                <strong>Parsing the Request:</strong> After receiving raw data from the client using <code>recv()</code>, the server needs to figure out what the client is asking for.
                <br><br>

                The data the server receives is usually a plain-text <strong>HTTP request</strong>. A very simple one might look like this:
                <pre><code>GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept: text/html
</code></pre>

                The first line, called the <strong>request line</strong>, is the most important. It follows this format:
                <br>
                <code>[METHOD] [PATH] [VERSION]</code>
                <br><br>
                For example:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>GET</code> → the method (what kind of action the client wants)</li>
                    <li><code>/</code> → the path (what resource the client wants, like <code>/index.html</code>)</li>
                    <li><code>HTTP/1.1</code> → the version of HTTP being used</li>
                </ul>

                In C, the server typically uses functions like <code>strstr()</code> or <code>sscanf()</code> to find and extract the method and path. Here’s a simple example:

                <pre><code>char method[8], path[1024];
sscanf(request_buffer, "%s %s", method, path);</code></pre>

                This extracts the first two words from the request, the method and the path, and stores them in variables so the server can make decisions based on them.
                <br><br>

                Once the server knows:
                <ul>
                    <li>What kind of request it is (e.g., <code>GET</code>)</li>
                    <li>What file or page is being requested (e.g., <code>/</code> or <code>/about.html</code>)</li>
                </ul>
                it can move on to <strong>handling the request</strong>.
            </li>


            <li>
                <strong>Handling the Request:</strong> After the server has parsed the client's request and knows what they’re asking for, it needs to decide how to respond.
                <br><br>

                The server first checks if the request method is supported. This server only supports the <code>GET</code> method, which means “fetch a file or page.” If the method is something like <code>POST</code> or <code>DELETE</code>, the server will respond with an error (but do look into these on your own! They're just as interesting).
                <br><br>

                Here’s an example in C:
                <pre><code>if (strcmp(method, "GET") != 0) {
    /* Method not allowed, send back a 405 response */
}</code></pre>

                If the method is <code>GET</code>, the server moves on to figure out which file the client is asking for. The <code>path</code> from the request tells us this.

                <ul>
                    <li>If the path is <code>/</code>, that usually means the client wants the homepage, so the server looks for a file like <code>index.html</code>.</li>
                    <li>If the path is something like <code>/about.html</code>, the server looks for a file named exactly that in the <code>public/</code> directory.</li>
                </ul>

                In C, this might look like:
                <pre><code>char filepath[1024];
if (strcmp(path, "/") == 0) {
    strcpy(filepath, "public/index.html");
} else {
    snprintf(filepath, sizeof(filepath), "public%s", path);
}</code></pre>

                At this point, the server has:
                <ul>
                    <li>Verified that the request method is allowed</li>
                    <li>Converted the request path into a file path on disk</li>
                </ul>

                If the file exists, the server will read it and prepare to send it back to the client. If it doesn’t, it will return a <code>404 Not Found</code> error instead. This server has a 404 page as well!
                <br><br>
            </li>


            <li>
                <strong>Reading from Disk:</strong> Once the server has figured out which file the client wants (like <code>public/index.html</code>), it needs to open that file and read its contents so it can send them back in the HTTP response.
                <br><br>
                The server uses file I/O functions in C like <code>fopen()</code>, <code>fread()</code>, and <code>fclose()</code> to load the requested file:

                <pre><code>FILE* file = fopen(filepath, "r");
if (file == NULL) {
    // File not found – will send 404 later
} else {
    // Read file contents into a buffer
}</code></pre>

                The server typically:
                <ol>
                    <li>Opens the file in read mode.</li>
                    <li>Checks if the file exists. If not, it plans to send a <code>404 Not Found</code>.</li>
                    <li>If the file exists, it reads all the content into memory using something like <code>fread()</code>.</li>
                    <li>Stores the content in a buffer so it can be included in the response body later.</li>
                    <li>Closes the file using <code>fclose()</code> when done.</li>
                </ol>

                Here’s an example of reading the file content:

                <pre><code>fseek(file, 0, SEEK_END);
long length = ftell(file);
fseek(file, 0, SEEK_SET);

char* body = malloc(length + 1);
fread(body, 1, length, file);
body[length] = '\0';

fclose(file);</code></pre>

                At this point, the server has the file’s contents stored in memory, ready to send back to the client. Now it just needs to build a proper HTTP response around that content.
            </li>


            <li>
                <strong>Sending the Response:</strong> Now that the server has the contents of the file in memory, it needs to wrap that content in a proper <strong>HTTP response</strong> and send it back to the client (like a browser).
                <br><br>

                An HTTP response has three main parts:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Status line</strong> → Tells the browser whether the request was successful (e.g., <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</code>).</li>
                    <li><strong>Headers</strong> → Provide extra information like the content type and length.</li>
                    <li><strong>Body</strong> → The actual content of the file (e.g., the HTML of the web page).</li>
                </ol>

                Here’s a very simple HTTP response the server might send:
                <pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 123

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;...&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

                To build this response in C, the server first creates a response header as a string:

                <pre><code>char header[1024];
sprintf(header,
  "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n"
  "Content-Type: text/html\r\n"
  "Content-Length: %ld\r\n"
  "Connection: close\r\n\r\n",
  length);</code></pre>

                Then it sends both the header and the body using the <code>send()</code> function:

                <pre><code>send(client_socket, header, strlen(header), 0);
send(client_socket, body, length, 0);</code></pre>

                Together, this tells the browser:
                <ul>
                    <li>"Everything went fine!" (<code>200 OK</code>)</li>
                    <li>"Here's some HTML."</li>
                    <li>"The page you're seeing is <code>index.html</code> (or whatever file was requested)."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>


            <li>
                <strong>Error Handling:</strong> Sometimes thing happen: the client might request a file that doesn’t exist, or use a method the server doesn’t support. When that happens, the server needs to send back an appropriate error response so the client knows what went wrong.
                <br><br>

                There are two common types of errors this server might handle:

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>404 Not Found:</strong> The client asked for a file that doesn’t exist (like <code>/cats.html</code> when no such file is on disk).</li>
                    <li><strong>405 Method Not Allowed:</strong> The client used an HTTP method the server doesn’t support (like <code>POST</code> instead of <code>GET</code>).</li>
                </ul>

                When either of these happens, the server constructs a basic error response instead of trying to serve a real file.

                For example, to handle a missing file (404):

                <pre><code>const char* response_404 =
  "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\r\n"
  "Content-Type: text/html\r\n"
  "Content-Length: 65\r\n"
  "Connection: close\r\n\r\n"
  "&lt;h1&gt;404 Not Found&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The requested file was not found.&lt;/p&gt;";

send(client_socket, response_404, strlen(response_404), 0);</code></pre>

                And for a bad method (405):

                <pre><code>const char* response_405 =
  "HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed\r\n"
  "Content-Length: 0\r\n"
  "Connection: close\r\n\r\n";

send(client_socket, response_405, strlen(response_405), 0);</code></pre>

                These responses follow the same format as normal ones (status line, headers, body) but they explain that something went wrong. Now all we have to do is close the connection.
            </li>


            <li>
                <strong>Closing Connection:</strong> After the server has sent a response, it has to clean up. The conversation with the client is over, so the server needs to close the connection and get ready for the next one.
                <br><br>

                This is done with the <code>close()</code> function in C:

                <pre><code>close(client_socket);</code></pre>

                This tells the operating system:
                <em>"We're done talking to this client, free any resources used."</em>
                <br><br>

                Why close the connection? Because keeping too many connections open wastes memory and slows things down. Our HTTP/1.1 server typically closes the connection after every request.

                <br><br>
                After closing the client’s socket, the server goes back to the <strong>accept()</strong> step and waits for the next incoming request.
